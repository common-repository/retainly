This plugin is for bloggers/websites developed with wordpress that would like to capture their subscribers with the opt-in forms. Most of the tasks of this plugin will be done by the admin while the site viewers may just enter their email id and/or name that will be sent to their Retainly account via Retainly API. This is forked and developed from the Rapidology with over 100 responsive templates and 7 different display types for growing your email newsletter!

It is the free plugin with over 100 responsive templates and 7 different display 
types for growing your email newsletter!

Requires Wordpress version of at least 3.5, tested up to 4.7. The
Current stable tag is 1.1.


Add these seven types of email list-builders to your Wordpress website:

*	Popup Opt-In Forms: Prompt your visitors to opt in without annoying them. You can set Retainly’s popup opt-in forms to appear automatically after a specific amount of time, after visitors reach a particular point on your page, or even after visitors leave a comment or make a purchase.

*	Slide-In Opt-In Forms: The slide-in form is the pop-up’s smooth, subtle cousin. It slides in at the bottom of your visitor’s screen, and can be set to appear after a specific time or at a specific point on the page.

*	Widget Opt-In Forms: Use widget forms to create attractive opt-in forms for your sidebar, footer, or any other widget-friendly areas on your site.

*	Protected Content Opt-In Forms: Offering valuable content in exchange for an email address is one of the most effective ways to grow your email list. Protected content forms allow you to offer content your visitors can “unlock” by opting in.

*	Below Content Opt-In Forms: You can use “Below Content” forms to place an opt-in opportunity at the end of your blog posts or pages. Visitors who have read an entire post are highly engaged, so this is an effective way to turn that engagement into a conversion.

*	Inline Opt-In Forms: Want to insert an opt-in form in the middle of a blog post, rather than the end? Inline forms make it easy. You can display these forms virtually anywhere you’d like on any post or page on your website.

*	Notification/Opt-In Bar:  Increase your opt-ins, announce your promotions and drive traffic to the pages of your choice with our attention grabbing top-of-page banner.  

You can find out how all of your opt-in forms are performing right inside your Retainly dashboard. We provide elegant visualizations of your conversion rates, impressions, subscriber counts, and more, so you can track your performance at a glance.
